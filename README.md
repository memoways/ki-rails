# Ki-Rails

[Ki](http://ki-lang.org/) adapter for the Rails asset pipeline.

## Installation

Ideally you'd just have to add this to your Gemfile:

    gem 'ki-rails'

Now, we haven't pushed any version yet, because the code needs a serious
clean up. Patience!

## Running tests

No tests yet.

## Code Status

Travis CI / badge.fury.io / gemnasium integration would be great here.
